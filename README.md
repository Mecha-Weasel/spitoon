Project "Spittoon"
------------------

Instructions to test Weasel's highlighted-server-browser (HSB) client-side modification:

NOTE-1: This is all USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

If you have FoF open, close it.

Make a backup copy of the original/official "client.dll" file on your computer.
It should be located here in this folder (for Windows):
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fistful of Frags\fof\bin

Download the unofficial/modded "client.dll" file from this GitHub and use it to replace the original/official version:
https://github.com/Mecha-Weasel/spittoon/tree/main/fof/bin

Start FoF again.
Click "Multiplayer" and give it a moment to refresh.

As always, exactly which servers show-up will vary greatly.
But, the potential pool includes 30 working IP address now, instead of just 13.
Also, each IP address may have several servers associated with it (ala Kyekful, etc.) (edited)
